    <code align="center"><div>It's me... I'm Mr. ImMe 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div align="center"><img src="images/man1.2.gif" alt=""></div>
        And if im not wrong... you must be YOU, right?
        <br>
        <code align="center"><div style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">I'm just here to tell you a super <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> thing!
            <br>
            <br>
            But let me first start of with this...There is actually a reason to why my name is 
            Mr. ImMe and it all starts from the beginning kindergarden.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have never been the coolest person in the world, I've been shy, I had bigger ears and the other kids, 
            <br>
            or so they said... the other kids... and never had the newest, coolest clothes. This made me a perfect victim for bullying.
            <br>
            There where many many times i was thinking if they were right, 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/man2.2.gif" alt="">
            <br>
            <em>maybe i am all of those thing they said:</em>
            <br>

        </div></code>
            <ul align="left" style="margin-left: 37%;">
                
                <li><b>Ugly</b></li>
                <li><b>Not good enough</b></li>
                <li><b>Looking like an elephant</b></li>
                
            </ul>

            <code align="center"><div style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;">
            the list went on and on...
            <br>
            <br>
            This made me hate school and everything about it,
            <br>
            and so it went on for around 7 years, every, every day.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/man3.2.gif" alt="">
            <br>
            I was so sad and angry... didn't know how to handle it or be free from it.
            <br>
            <br>
            ...
            <br>
            <br>
            One day i decided that enough is enough!
            <br>
            I stopped care about what people though of me... it was very hard from the beginning.
            <br>
            But at last I did learn to love myself for who i am!
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/man4.2.gif" alt="">
